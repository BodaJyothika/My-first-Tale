<p>
Once there lived a woman in the woods, far away from the mean town...<br> 
The woman was abandoned in the woods by her parents due to her incapability of being dark.<br>
She began to live alone in the woods. Despite being alone, she built a beautiful castle for herself with abundant things.<br><br>
 
Once there came a woman from the town to the castle and asked for the firewood. The woman welcomed her and gave her the firewood...<br><br>
 
Once there came a girl from the town to the castle and asked for the fruits. The woman welcomed her and gave her the fruits...<br><br>

Once there came a boy from the town to the castle and asked for the flowers for his beloved little girlfriend. The woman giggled and welcomed him and gave him the flowers....<br><br>
 
Once there came a man from the town to the castle and asked for the woman's hand...<br>
Being alone for the long time, the woman agreed. She fell in love with the man...<br>
As time passed, the man too abandoned her for another woman...<br>
Heartbroken the woman cried in agony for months and swore herself not to fall in love again. She took ages to move on, and finally she did…<br><br>

Once there came a granny from the town to the castle and asked for the wool to make a cardigan. The woman welcomed her and gave her the wool and asked if she could make her one… Granny said no and left the castle.<br><br> 

Days passed……<br><br>

The woman began to fall out of things, except for a few.<br><br>
 
Once there came a grandpa from the town to the castle and asked for the seeds to sow. The woman welcomed him and gave him the seeds to sow...<br><br>
 
Once there came a man from the town to the castle and asked for the woman's hand...<br>
The flashbacks of her ex-man hit her all at once and she disagreed.. <br>
Stubborn The man never left a day without asking her out..<br>
Although Heartbroken once, the woman still fell for the man and put all her trust in him..<br><br>

The man didn't visit her for a day and she became worried...<br> 
A week passed and there were no traces of the man…<br><br>

For the first time, the woman stepped out of the castle and went to the town to meet her lover...<br>
only to be greeted by the sight of her lover with another woman…<br>
Feeling deceived, the woman asked the man for an explanation only to hear,<br>
   <center>  “ You are dark, and I found a prettier woman than you, I'm going to marry her…”</center><br><br>

Heartbroken for the second time, the woman returned to the castle with a heavy broken heart...<br><br>

The woman led the next few days with despairs. All her abundant things ran out..<br><br>

She starved for days...<br><br>

she went to the town hoping for a helping hand, but received none…..<br>
None from the town welcomed her, not even the one she welcomed to her castle. <br>
Dumb struck the woman returned to her castle. She was appalled of her current state and began to cry in pain…<br><br>

She tried to take her own life, only to be abandoned by her death.<br><br> 

The woman prayed for the God's visit....<br><br>

Days passed….<br><br>

Weeks passed…. <br><br>

Months passed… <br><br>

Years passed…<br><br>

And finally, the God paid her a visit....<br><br>

The woman put all her agonies in front of the god and asked,<br>
<p align="center">
“Why did no one help me when I ran out of things? <br>
Why is there no helping hand for me when I had been the One?<br> 
Why did all the ones I cared for never cared for me? <br>
Why did everyone abandon me? <br>
Why did no one love me?<br> 
Why was I no one's first priority? <br>
Why did no one understand me? <br>
Why was there no one with me when I am in my depths of despair?<br> 
Why God?  Why?......”<br><br> </p>

Only to receive silence as an answer from the God….<br><br>

She then realized that even the God abandoned her!!!</p>
